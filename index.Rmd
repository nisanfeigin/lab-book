## Adding to the lab book
Adding to the lab book is very easy.

#### Option 1: non-computational
1. Go to the [lab-book]() repository on the dropbox.
2. Make and save the relevant changes to the .Rmd file in question
   + There is one .Rmd file per chapter.
3. Email Julie & Avishay so that they can render the book.

#### Option 2: computational
Note: this will only work for those whose github users have been added to the book repository (i.e. Julie & Avishay). If you have a github account and would like to be added, let us know.

1. Go to the [lab-book]() repository on the dropbox  
   + OR clone the repository locally and go there. To clone:  
   + In terminal: `git clone https://github.com/jlaffy/lab-book.git`  
2. Make and save the relevant changes to the .Rmd file in question.
   + There is one .Rmd file per chapter.
3. In R: `bookdown::render_book(input='index.html')`
   + Make sure you first install the bookdown package:  
     In R: `install.packages('bookdown')`
4. In terminal: `git commit -am 'myShortMessage'`
5. In terminal: `git push origin master`

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
