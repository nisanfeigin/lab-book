## Adding to the book
Adding to the lab book is easy. The only requirement is that you [make a Github account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), which shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to do. 

Note that since the book is re-built with each edit made, **you may have to wait a few minutes before your changes become visible**.

### Option 1: Edit via the book website (recommended)
1. Go to the website chapter that you would like to edit.
    + E.g. [Chapter 3 Lab members and contact details](https://tiroshlab.github.io/lab-book/contact.html)
2. Click on the edit icon at the top of the website page.
3. Make your edits and submit them (green button at the bottom of the page).

### Option 2: Edit via the GitHub website
1. Go to the chapter file that you would like to edit.
   + E.g. [02-labMembersContact.Rmd](https://github.com/tiroshlab/lab-book/blob/master/02-labMembersContact.Rmd)
2. Click on the edit icon.
3. Make your edits and submit them by clicking the green **Commit changes** button.
 
### Option 3: Edit using the git command line interface
**Note**: this will only work for those whose Github users have been added to the book repository.

1. Go to your local clone of the repository.
    + to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tiroshlab/lab-book.git`  
2. Make and save the relevant changes to the .Rmd file in question.
    + There is one .Rmd file per chapter.
3. Submit the edit. In the terminal type:
    + `git commit -am <myShortMessage>`
    + `git pull origin master`
    + `git push origin master`
