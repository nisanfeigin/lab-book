["general.html", "Chapter 2 General research directions of the lab 2.1 ITH mechanisms 2.2 ITH functional/clinical implications 2.3 Approach 2.4 Experimentally 2.5 Computationally 2.6 Biological contexts", " Chapter 2 General research directions of the lab We are a cancer systems biology lab, focused on intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH). Our main goal is to understand ITH, the mechanisms that generate and maintain it, and the functional and clinical implications. 2.1 ITH mechanisms We consider three main types of mechanisms: 1. Genetic heterogeneity (genetic subclones). 2. Microenvironmental influences (e.g. oxygen/nutrient availability and cell-cell interactions) 3. Intrinsic cellular plasticity (cells dynamically transitioning between states). 2.2 ITH functional/clinical implications We are interested in all implications of ITH but focus primarily on the questions of drug resistance, cancer stem cells and metastasis/invasion, all of which have highly significant clinical implications. 2.3 Approach We use a systems biology approach, which means that we combine experimental and computational approaches to address these questions from a global perspective, typically through single cell RNA-seq or other high-throughput profiling approaches, followed by extensive computational analyses, and experimental validations. 2.4 Experimentally We emphasize the ability to work directly with patient samples and to that end we work closely with clinicians. In addition, we work with “simple” model systems (cancer cell lines), but only after we verify that they recapitulate certain aspects of heterogeneity as seen in tumors. We tend to avoid working with complex models and with experimental systems that are difficult and slow to work with, such as mice models, although this is possible through collaborations with other labs. Our main experimental method is scRNA-seq, but we try to combine it and follow up with complementary approaches (FACS analysis, spatial analyses, time-course experiments, ATAC-seq) which will expand and evolve with time. 2.5 Computationally We emphasize a biology-centered and data-driven approach, and hence perform hands-on extensive, iterative, and integrative data analyses while avoiding the “blind” use of computational tool. We do not focus on any particular computational methodology but attempt to use the appropriate method for each analysis, while keeping the analysis intuitive and simple. 2.6 Biological contexts We study primarily glioma and head and neck cancer. These are long-term directions in which we collaborate closely with experimental/clinical groups (Mario Suva from Boston and Sid Puram from St. Louis), striving to deeply understand the underlying biology and ultimately make a clinical impact. We are currently starting also a third focus on neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), in collaboration with Amit Tirosh from Sheba Medical Center (no family relations). In addition, specific projects involve other contexts due to either exceptional diversity (e.g. Carcinosarcomas: tumors that contain both carcinoma and sarcoma cells), or collaborative efforts (e.g. in ovarian and pancreatic cancer).

["projects.html", "Chapter 4 Specific Projects", " Chapter 4 Specific Projects Alissa My two main projects are 1) Modeling ITH in cancer cell lines with a focus on dynamics, differential drug sensitivity, and cancer cell-cancer cell interactions in HNSCC (with Rotem). 2) Spatial transcriptomics of GBM (in collaboration with the Suva Lab). Rony My thesis focuses on GBM intra-tumor heterogeneity, for which I have 3 projects in collaboration with Mario Suva’s lab at MGH: 1) modeling the GBM states in cancer cell lines and a mouse model of GBM, 2) exploring the GBM microenvironment cell-cell interactions in regards to the cellular states, and 3) targeting the GBM states as a therapeutic approach for GBM. Mike My work concerns deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to identify signatures of tumour subpopulations or cell states. My current project focuses on distinguishing EMT (or partial EMT) from stromal cells in bulk transcriptomes. Michael My work broadly focuses on ITH in head and neck cancer. In collaboration with Sid Puram’s lab I analyse scRNASeq data from patients with oropharyngeal, laryngeal and oral cavity cancer in order to find tumour genetic subclones and functional metaprograms in the cancer cells and microenvironment. Noam H My work is to do a regulatory follow up to lab discoveries on chromatin organization level using single cell ATAC-seq on two main ITH projects: 1) head and neck cancer 2) GBM. Julie My work focuses on understanding expression heterogeneity in gliomas. I analyse primarily scRNA-seq data from the Suva lab to 1) define the subpopulations of cancer cells that exist in different glioma types, 2) understand the emergence of these subpopulations as a function of cell lineage, genetics and the TME and 3) revisit the distinctions between glioma types. Noam G My project focuses on deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to identify and distinguish IFN response and MHC class ii genes in cancer cells from immune cells. "],

The code is written in R and is publicly available via GitHub (see below). It was designed with a modular approach and hence is separated into several well-defined packages. The packages and functions are well documented and examples are provided within each package. 8.1 About the R packages 8.1.1 scandal Source code | Report bugs A framework that enables defining a single-cell experiment. The package provides methods for loading the data, preprocessing and quality control, maintaining the data with a low memory footprint (using sparse matrices), various plotting methods, linking meta-data with expression data and more. The package extends the SingleCellExperiment class, adapting it for use in our lab. See this tutorial for an introduction to the SingleCellExperiment class. To install in R: devtools::install_github(&quot;dravishays/scandal&quot;) 8.1.2 infercna Website &amp; Tutorials | Functions index | Source code | Report bugs Infer copy-number alterations from (single-cell) RNA-sequencing data. The methodology implemented here was first formulated by Itay and colleagues during his postdoc Tirosh et al., 2014 and has been tried and tested in several publications since (Filbin et al., 2018; Neftel et al., 2019; Puram et al., 2017; Tirosh et al., 2016a, 2016b; Venteicher et al., 2017).

Items ordered from the machsan include all disposables (i.e. tubes, gloves, pipettes), common/basic equipment (i.e timers, pipettors, lab coats), most tissue culture reagents (i.e. media, PBS), basic chemicals (i.e. ethanol, DMSO), and commonly used reagents (i.e. kits for qPCR, cDNA synthesis, RNA isolation). Warehouse orders are placed through the Tafnit system. Alissa regularly places orders but Rotem and Rony also have access to Tafnit (if anyone else would like access, please ask Michal Ovadia; note that the system is only available in Hebrew). When an item on the list is ordered, it should be marked with a checkmark. When the item arrives, it should be erased from the list. Orders from the machsan usually arrive within 3-4 days of being placed. If it is urgent, it is possible to call the warehouse and arrange to pick up an item in person from Piccioto after the order is received. 10.2 General ordering All items that aren’t ordered from the warehouse can be ordered with a price quote. In principle, some items from Sigma and Grafiti can also be ordered via Tafnit, though it is usually easier to order via price quote. Receiving a price quote requires knowing the local distributor of the product - many company websites will have a list of international distributors. Below, you will also find contact info for many of the most relevant distributors. To receive a price quote, email the relevant distributor with the catalog number and manufacturer. You can also ask how long it will take for the product to arrive if it’s time sensitive (many products are ordered from abroad). Include in the quote request or in your email signature that you are from the Tirosh lab and lab address/departmental affiliation. You can forward price quotes to Natali (natalie.yikne@weizmann.ac.il) and she will place the order. 10.3 Office supplies Graffiti is the office supply distributor for the Weizmann Institute. Their inventory/catalog can be found on their website. You can receive a price quote from liatji@graf.co.il. 10.4 Antibodies In the Tirosh Lab dropbox, there is an excel file listing the details of the antibodies we have in the lab. Please consult it before ordering a new antibody and please update it when you receive a new antibody. Biocompare.com is a useful site for finding antibodies. You can filter your search with reactive species, conjugated fluorophores, and by application (IHC, flow, etc). There are many vendors of varying reputation for antibodies — please ask if you have questions about quality or which vendor to choose. For selecting fluorophores for FACS antibodies, the BD spectrum viewer is a helpful tool for selecting panels of antibodies without spectral overlap. Below are some recommended antibody vendors and their local distributors. For FACS antibodies: eBioscience (Rhenium), Biolegend (Enco), Miltenyi (Almog) For immunohistochemistry/immunocytochemistry antibodies: Abcam (Zotal), R&amp;D (Biotest) For price quotes: Rhenium (eBioscience, Thermofisher) - Yaara Willensky yaara@rhenium.co.il Almog (Miltenyi) - Aviva Blechman Peretz aviva@almog.co.il Biotest (R&amp;D) - Laora laora@biotest.co.il Zotal (Abcam) - Anna Bernstein anna@zotal.co.il Enco (Biolegend) - Yifat Ovadia - Yifat@enco.co.il 10.5 Molecular biology Many popular molecular biology kits/products can be found in the warehouse (for qPCR we are typically using Applied Biosystems FAST SYBR green, for cDNA synthesis we like the Applied Biosystems high capacity cDNA kit, both available from the warehouse). For RNA isolation, Qiagen kits are available from the warehouse, though our favorite is the Zymo Quick RNA micro prep kit (Zotal is the distributor). 10.6 Growth factors Please check the growth factors/cytokine spreadsheet in the Tirosh Lab dropbox to see inventory and please update when you receive something new. We have good experience ordering growth factors/cytokines from Peprotech located in Park HaMada (email ori@peprotechasia.com for quotes) and from Sino Biological (email Yifat Ovadia - Yifat@enco.co.il for a quote). 10.7 Miltenyi/MACS products Almog is the supplier for Miltenyi products including reagents/disposables for the OctoMACS tissue dissociator, the dead cell removal kit, and MACS beads/reagants. Email aviva@almog.co.il or netta@almog.co.il for quotes. There is an option to either place an individual order or to join the monthly departmental order which saves money but takes longer. If your order is non-urgent, you can request the FOB price and ask Natali to add it to the monthly departmental order when you send her the quote. 10.8 Drugs Cayman Chemicals is a reasonably priced and reliable supplier for drugs/compounds. Their distributor is Enco (Yifat@enco.co.il for quotes). Other vendors for drugs/chemical compounds include Sigma/Merck (shir.yohai@merckgroup.com), Molport (jose.garcia-tenorio@molport.com), and Selleck (manager@tivanbiotech.com). 10.9 Chemicals Sigma/Merck is the largest distributor for chemicals. Many common chemicals can be ordered via the warehouse; Sigma price quote requests can be sent to shir.yohai@merckgroup.com. 10.10 Primers For primer design, everyone has their favorite program, but NCBI Primer BLAST is a good place to start. We order primers through IDT/Syntezza (idtdna.com). You can create your own user account with IDT on their site. Since primers are inexpensive and we tend to place small orders, we keep a standing order with IDT. In the payment order field, you can write ‘Tirosh lab standing order’. You can email Chany Frankel (chany@syntezza.com) to confirm that there is money remaining in the standing order or to request to add money to the standing order via a price quote. 10.11 Illumina kits Danyel Biotech is the distributor for Illumina sequencing kits (request a quote from sigal@danyel.co.il). The current kit in use for the NextSeq 500/550 is the NextSeq 500 high output kit (75 cycles) FC-4-4-2005. "],

To permanently update the $PATH variable, add the export command to your ~/.bashrc. 17.3 Database Some data are used by several labs at Weizmann and as such WEXAC have put a significant amount of data under /share/db. You can check whether for example your desired genome sequence or index file already exists here before downloading it yourself. 17.4 Our server on WEXAC Our server or ‘compute node’ is called cn077. It has ~200GB RAM and 1 core (Nov ‘19). cn077 can be accessed directly or via one of four ‘access nodes’ (access1, access2, access3, access4) whose job it is to properly manage and distribute memory between lab members. For this reason, if you’re working interactively on the server you should primarily use one of the access nodes. It shouldn’t matter which of the four you use. Access access node: ssh &lt;username&gt;@access4.wexac.weizmann.ac.il compute node: ssh &lt;username&gt;@cn077.wexac.weizmann.ac.il 17.5 Submitting jobs If you are running something that requires substantial memory/time, you should submit this as a job to one of the queues on WEXAC (or sit back and wait to receive a call from HPC). To name a few queues: tirosh new-short new-medium new-long new-all Which queue you choose can depend on a number of things: job duration &amp; memory requirements, how busy a queue is and which compute node it is associated with. For example, the tirosh queue runs jobs on cn077. Since cn077 is private, the queue is not busy (relatively speaking) and your job may start running sooner. On the other hand since cn077 only has 1 core, a computationally-intensive job may finish more slowly than on a queue with multiple cores. For more information on available queues: bqueues -a To submit a job: bsub -q &lt;queue&gt; &lt;job&gt; Jobs are by default allocated 1GB of RAM. If this is not enough: bsub -q &lt;queue&gt; -R &quot;rusage[mem=XGB]&quot; &lt;job&gt;, or bsub -q &lt;queue&gt; -R &quot;select[mem&gt;XGB]&quot; &lt;job&gt; where X is the (minimum) amount of memory you want to allocate, up to 150GB. bjobs lists currently running and pending jobs. bkill &lt;job ID&gt; kills job. Job ID is given in bjobs output. bpeek to glance at job progress (STDOUT, STDERR). See also -o and -e flags in bsub. "]
