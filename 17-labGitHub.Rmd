# Lab GitHub Account {#labGitHub}

The lab has a shared github account called `tiroshlab` [(link to webpage)](https://github.com/tiroshlab). This allows an unlimited number of us to collaborate on multiple projects (also known as *repositories*) at once, and also provides a page to which non-lab-members can navigate to see, download or contribute (upon request) to our code.


## How do I join?
To become a member of the account, you should send your GitHub username to Julie (julie.laffy@weizmann.ac.il) or to Mike (michael.tyler@weizmann.ac.il). If you don't have a personal account, you should first sign up at [this link](https://github.com/signup). Once you're added, you'll be able to easily make changes to existing projects or add new ones.


## What is an organization account and how do I sign in?
`tiroshlab` is an organization account: like personal accounts, organizations can own resources such as repositories, packages, and projects. However, **you cannot sign into an organization.** Instead, **each person signs into their own personal account, and any actions the person takes on organization resources are attributed to their personal account.** Each personal account can be a member of multiple organizations.

## How do I add or edit a repository?
### Option 1: Using the GitHub website
- To add a new repository, navigate to the `tiroshlab` GitHub page [(link)](https://github.com/tiroshlab), and click the green button "New".
- To make changes to an existing repository, navigate to the GitHub page in question (e.g. [3CA project](https://github.com/tiroshlab/3ca)) and use the icons to add files or open existing files.
### Option 2: Using the git command line interface
Proceed as you would for any other git repository, and using your personal git credentials to push/pull commits to the `tiroshlab` repository.


## How do I add or edit the lab book?
The lab book is one of the GitHub repositories on the `tiroshlab` account [(link to GitHub page)](https://github.com/tiroshlab/lab-book). [(link to website)](https://tiroshlab.github.io/lab-book/). Therefore, broadly speaking, you can add or edit it as you would any other repository. However, we also built the book as a website, and this form is perhaps the easiest to make small edits to. See [Section 1.2: Adding to the book](https://tiroshlab.github.io/lab-book/index.html#adding-to-the-book) for more details.
